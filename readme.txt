Taywin Otti, Samuel Williams, Asia Trubachova

Tay focused on the Adventurer class and Docstrings, estimate time spent: ~4 hours
Asia focused on the Room and Dungeon Adventure class + DFS algorithm in the Dungeon class, estimate time spent: ~6 hours
Sam focused on the Dungeon class and UML diagrams, estimate time spent: ~4 hours

Also we had biweekly meetings which took approximately 5-6 hours, during which we discussed our code, and coded along in complicated cases.

Shortcomings: 
not enough time to make the GUI, will work on that during winter break
can still improve dungeon generation algorithm, especially on the neighbors assignment (Asia: I feel like the functions can be simplified, will work on that on the winter break)



For extra credit, we added docStrings to the classes. 
Also, to ensure that dungeon is passable, we implemented a dfs algorithm.
